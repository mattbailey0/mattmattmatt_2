I"¡<p>Midwinter Bulbsprout is a new eco-horror track from my project Mouth Noises about seeing green shoots popping up in early February. I made this using modular synthesizers and a keyboard.</p>

<p>The art I made using Processing.js and public domain images released recently by some British museum.</p>
