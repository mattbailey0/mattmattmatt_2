I"X<p>Things Stir Apart is an album that I mostly wrote in 2019, using a variety of experimental approaches. I learned a huge amount making this thing, and I think some of it is pretty good! All of it is meant to be listened to loudly. <a href="https://mouthnoises.bandcamp.com/album/things-stir-apart">Stream or download it for free here</a></p>
