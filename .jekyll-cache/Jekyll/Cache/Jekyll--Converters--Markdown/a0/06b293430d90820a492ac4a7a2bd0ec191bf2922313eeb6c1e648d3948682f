I"»<p>This is a quick post to capture a collection of free resources for those who want to understand how people in various parts of the world use the web. I‚Äôll update it as I come across stuff. This initial list is largely focused on national or regional level patterns, such as what apps are most downloaded and what sites are most visited. Shout out to my colleagues at <a href="ndi.org">NDI</a> for several of these.</p>
