He also spends approximately one sentence defining his terms: what exactly is meant by analog and by digital? In the end he drives away from his childhood summer camp in the warm glow of nostalgia, opting for a Neil Young song on the radio in preference to streaming ""digital"" music, his windows down to let in the summer breeze. The irony is that the broadcast equipment, the radio in his car, and probably the car itself are all largely digital equipment. Oh and no, IDEO did not invent human centered design.
