Beats, because the way out is through.

For a while in late 2019/early 2020 I got really inspired by the idea of ecohorror. You know, the horrible sublimity of a warm morning in the middle of January or trying to picture what it means that the honey bees are all disappearing, probably also on a warm morning. Silent spring etc. Simpler times!

I made this live using modular analog synths and a keyboard. The art I made using Processing.js and [this painting](https://www.si.edu/object/girl-i-left-behind-me:saam_1986.79).
