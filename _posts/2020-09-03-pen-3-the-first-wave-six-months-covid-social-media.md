This spring and summer, my team and I at PEN America collected press releases and reporting about 13 of the most important social media platforms in order to paint a picture of their responses to the first six months of the pandemic. We published it as an open dataset and wrote about what we saw and learned through the process. It felt timely and important not only because the their actions have had impacts on public health, free expression, and culture broadly  that we probably won't understand fully for years to come, but because it seemed like a particularly useful window into the culture and strategic approaches of these companies that will be important headed into the elections in November and beyond.
