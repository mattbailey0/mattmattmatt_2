More & More for Ever & Ever is a song about JESUS HENRY CHRIST 2020 SURE WHY NOT LET'S DO THAT NOW WOOOOO

I recorded it live in a single take using a modular synth and a spider plant I'd connected to it using EEG paddles. The plant plays the higher synth voice and one of the bass parts, while I knob twiddle and play some piano.
