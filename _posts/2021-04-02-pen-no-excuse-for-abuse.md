No Excuse For Abuse is a new report that I co-authored with my colleagues Viktorya Vilk and Elodie Vialle. It builds on their work with journalists and writers and in particular those who identify as women, LGBTQIA+, BIPOC, and other groups who experience online harassment and abuse. Rather than regulation (also desperately needed), we focus on immediate product fixes the social media platforms need to put in place to empower those who are being targeted and limit the trauma entailed in just doing their jobs.
