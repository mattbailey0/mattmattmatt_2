These are images I created using [Processing](processing.org) to accompany a new song, [4am Mirror Slouch](/music/2021/05/24/4am-mirror-slouch.html). The images and the song are about related to insomnia, self, and maybe even [second sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biphasic_and_polyphasic_sleep#Historical_norm) is in there too. Idk. If you can't sleep you know what I mean. [Charles Simic does too](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/55186/mirrors-at-4-am).
