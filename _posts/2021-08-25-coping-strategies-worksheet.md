<i>Coping Strategies Worksheet</i> is a collection of songs I started writing just before the pandemic hit and finished up in the summer of 2021. I used modular synths, piano, guitar, code, and a houseplant and it ranges in genre from ambient to surf rock to weird IDM/demoscene inspired stuff. I'm really proud of how much more rich and intentional these songs turned out than the stuff that preceded it. Check it out if you have a second!
