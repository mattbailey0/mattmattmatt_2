Everyone is so _amped_ about the new generation of AI services and disinfo and repeating the mistakes of the last hypecycle. Remember people panicking about deepfakes when [cheapfakes were the real problem](https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/drunk-pelosi-deepfakes-cheapfakes-artificial-intelligence-disinformation.html)? This time, we're doomscrolling about OpenAI when [videogame engines](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/24/23655398/is-this-a-deepfake), [low fidelity deepfakes as a service](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z34jge/venezuela-ai-newscaster-disinformation) and the use of [paid political influencers](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-63719505) are all jamming along. Multiple kinds of synthetic media are converging - generative and predictive modeling, 3D graphics and gaming, "cheap" but powerful editing tools, and decontextualization of real media. AI is a shiny object in a burning building.
