Everyone is so _amped_ about disinformation re: the current generation of AI models/services like ChatGPT and Midjourney that we're already repeating the mistakes of the last hypecycle. Remember people panicking about deepfakes when [cheapfakes were the real problem](https://slate.com/technology/2019/06/drunk-pelosi-deepfakes-cheapfakes-artificial-intelligence-disinformation.html)? In this case, we're doomscrolling about OpenAI, when [videogame engines,](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/24/23655398/is-this-a-deepfake), [low fidelity deepfakes as a service](https://www.vice.com/en/article/z34jge/venezuela-ai-newscaster-disinformation) and the use of [paid political influencers](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-63719505) are all spreading globally? What we're actually seeing is the convergence multiple kinds of synthetic media - generative and predictive modeling, 3D graphics and gaming, "cheap" but powerful editing tools, and the commercialization of traditional influence operations techiques that include decontextualizing real media. Just like always, the shiny object is the flint spark in an already burning building.
