Last week I had the honor of being in Lusaka to support the government of Zambia's portion of the global second Summit for Democracy. The International Foundation for Electoral Systems and the Electoral Commission of Zambia co-hosted a day zero event on threats to electoral integrity and I talked about digital threats and how traditional electoral integrity frameworks aren't serving us well.

My argument: the elections community needs to take a page from the cybersecurity community and think about the "attack surface" of elections - including not only voting systems and the like but the information environment and all the civil society and corporate components that combined make or break elections and whether they are trusted.

The talk was streamed and is up on YouTube.
