Big news for those rooting for the Fediverse - Wordpress.com now officially supports the WordPress ActivityPub plugin. This is a big deal because Wordpress.com is something like the 4th largest platform in the US, and WordPress the open source software is used by ~42% of websites. Official support means a commitment to keeping ActivityPub integration working and a soft but significant nudge to the community that it's worth experimenting with. My bet is still with the Fediverse, including WP, Mastodon, and other integrators like WordPress to win out over other next-gen social media platforms. I hope! Announcement: ["Engage a Wider Audience With ActivityPub on WordPress.com"](https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/10/11/activitypub/) and a good place to keep track of how it goes: ["Fedidb WordPress stats"](https://fedidb.org/current-events/wordpress).
