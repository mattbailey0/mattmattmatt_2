Gray was a modern Scottish author who I somehow hadn't heard of. I appreciated his very short stories in this collection even more than the longer ones, in particular for their combination of whimsy and unstable allegory. His writing draws on folks like Swift or even Aesop, but at the last minute there is always unsettling lack of a simple moral or political message to the story. Except to indict power.
