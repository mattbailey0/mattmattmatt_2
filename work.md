Professionally, I am technologist working on democratic resilience and inclusion. That has taken me from grassroots activism to the White House and from cybersecurity to human (rights) centered design to civic tech and anticorruption. Now I am focusing on tech and elections. Hopefully the stuff included here, plus <a href="/writing">/writing</a> gives you a good sense. If you're interested in these kinds of things and believe in finding strategies to build a more equitable world, let's collaborate!
